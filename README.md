# Advent of Code 2022

For those not familiar, this is repo where I attempt the coding challenges for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) event.

This year due to a few things going on in my personal life I've decided not to learn a new language and instead focus on making it through the event, so we're going with an old faithful for me: C#.

## Running each puzzle

To get the answers for each day run `dotnet run --project .\code` from any given day folder. To run the unit tests simply run `dotnet test .\tests` from within any given day folder.

## Commentary
